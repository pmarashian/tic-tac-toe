# tic-tac-toe

This is an experiment using Angular and Firebase.  It is a simple multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game.  It uses Firebase to keep track of the game board.

You can run with two tabs in the same browser and test it.  You do not need to run it in two separate browsers.

There is an issue if a player leaves and the Firebase record isn't correctly amended, the player count is wrong and the rooms need to be purged.

Since this is a work in progress experiment, there is still debug data below the board.
